Captyon Non-Resale Attribution License (CS-NRA-1.0)

Copyright (c) 2025 github.com/rmcc3
All rights reserved.

Permission is granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, host, and operate the Software, including for commercial purposes, subject to the terms below.

1. Grant
   1.1 Scope. This is a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to use the Software as allowed here. No rights are granted by implication or estoppel.
   1.2 No Patent License. No patent rights are granted other than those strictly necessary to use the unmodified Software as permitted. If You initiate or join any patent claim alleging that the Software or a Derivative Work infringes a patent, this license terminates immediately.

2. Commercial Use
   2.1 Allowed. Commercial use is allowed provided the offering is not a Competing Offering and complies with Sections 3 and 4.
   2.2 SaaS and hosted use. Operating the Software as a network service is allowed only if the service provides Substantial Independent Value that is not primarily the operation of the Software itself.
   2.3 White labeling. You may not offer the Software or a Derivative Work as a white label, OEM, marketplace listing, template, or bundle where the primary value is the Software.

3. Attribution
   3.1 Required notices. Redistributions in source or binary form and all Derivative Works must include:
       a) Clear attribution: “Includes code from Captyon \(https://captyon.com\)”
       b) A copy of or link to this license
       c) Retention of existing copyright notices in all source files where they appear
   3.2 User-facing credit. Any user-facing product or service must present reasonably prominent attribution on a primary interface. Examples: main UI footer, About dialog reachable within one click, or initial setup screen.
   3.3 Visibility rules. Attribution must be legible on common display sizes, persistently available, not hidden behind toggles, paywalls, or hover-only interactions, and not suppressed for paid tiers.

4. Non-Resale and Primary Value
   4.1 No resale. You may not sell, resell, or sublicense the Software or a Derivative Work where the Software is the Primary Value of the offering.
   4.2 Primary Value test. The Software is deemed the Primary Value if any of the following is true:
       a) A reasonable end user would adopt the offering mainly to access functionality that the Software already provides, or
       b) Marketing materials, pricing pages, store listings, or documentation describe the offering primarily in terms of features that the Software provides, or
       c) Removal of the Software would cause the offering to lose more than 50 percent of its perceived utility to typical users.
   4.3 Insufficient additions. Cosmetic rebranding, minor UI wrappers, simple hosting, containerization, or trivial integrations do not create Substantial Independent Value.
   4.4 Permitted services. Installation, configuration, integration, support, or hosting may be sold only when bundled with Substantial Independent Value beyond deployment.

5. Derivative Works
   5.1 Definition. “Derivative Work” includes modifications, translations, extensions, plugins, packaging, containerization, static or dynamic linking, or combination with other code or services where the Software remains a core component.
   5.2 License flow-down. Derivative Works must comply with Sections 3 and 4 of this license. You may distribute Derivative Works only under terms no less protective of the Attribution and Non-Resale requirements.
   5.3 Source availability. This license does not require publication of source code. If You publish source, retain notices per Section 3.

6. Network Use and APIs
   6.1 Network use is distribution. Operating the Software to provide functionality to third parties over a network is treated as distribution for purposes of attribution and compliance.
   6.2 API endpoints. If the Software is exposed through an API, attribution must appear in the developer portal or documentation main page and within an accessible About or Legal section of any dashboard for the API product.

7. AI and ML Restrictions
   7.1 No competitive training. Neither the Software nor its outputs may be used to train machine learning models that aim to create a substantially similar or substitutive product or service without a separate commercial license.
   7.2 Research and internal models. Use for research or internal models is allowed if the resulting models are not marketed or used to provide functionality that competes with the Software as described in Sections 2 and 4.

8. Third-Party Components
   8.1 You must comply with licenses for third-party dependencies. Where a third-party license conflicts with this license for that component, the third-party terms control for that component only.

9. Trademarks and Trade Dress
   9.1 No rights are granted to use the names, logos, trademarks, service marks, or distinctive visual styles of the Copyright Owner, except for required attribution.
   9.2 No confusing similarity. You may not use branding that is likely to cause confusion regarding source, sponsorship, or affiliation.

10. Compliance, Audit, and Reporting
   10.1 Records. Maintain reasonable records sufficient to demonstrate compliance with Sections 3 and 4.
   10.2 Audit. The Copyright Owner may request an audit no more than twice per year with 10 business days notice. Audits occur during normal business hours and are limited to materials reasonably necessary to verify compliance. Confidential information will be handled under a mutual NDA if requested.
   10.3 Notice and cure. For remediable breaches, You have 15 days from written notice to cure before termination, except for intentional removal of attribution or prohibited resale, which terminates immediately.

11. Termination
   11.1 Automatic termination. Any violation of this license terminates Your rights automatically.
   11.2 Post-termination. On termination, You must stop all use and distribution and destroy or delete all copies within Your control. Sections 1.2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 14 survive termination.

12. Disclaimer of Warranty
   THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

13. Limitation of Liability
   TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL THE COPYRIGHT OWNER BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR GOODWILL, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SOFTWARE OR THIS LICENSE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY. DIRECT DAMAGES ARE LIMITED TO 100 USD.

14. Governing Law, Venue, and Injunctive Relief
   14.1 Governing law. This license is governed by the laws of the State of New Jersey, USA, without regard to conflict of laws rules.
   14.2 Venue. The exclusive venue for disputes is the state or federal courts located in New Jersey, and the parties consent to personal jurisdiction there.
   14.3 Equitable relief. Breach of Sections 3, 4, or 7 may cause irreparable harm. The Copyright Owner may seek injunctive relief without posting bond.

15. Export, Sanctions, and Compliance
   You represent that You are not located in, under the control of, or a national or resident of any country or entity subject to U.S. embargoes or sanctions, and You will comply with applicable export control laws.

16. Assignment
   You may not assign or transfer this license, by operation of law or otherwise, without prior written consent of the Copyright Owner. Any unauthorized assignment is void.

17. Entire Agreement, Severability, and Waiver
   This license is the entire agreement regarding the Software. If any provision is held unenforceable, the remainder stays in effect. Failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver.
