Copyright (c) 2025 github.com/rmcc3

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, and otherwise exploit the Software for any purpose, including commercial purposes, subject to the following conditions:

1. Commercial Use
   - Commercial use of the Software is permitted provided the Software is not offered in a manner that competes directly with the original project without substantial additional value.
   - SaaS/hosted services based primarily on the Software must include substantial, independent features or services beyond operation of the Software itself.
   - All commercial uses must comply with the Attribution and Non-Resale requirements in Sections 2 and 3.

2. Attribution / Credit
   - Redistributions of the Software, in source or binary form, or any Derivative Works must include:
     a) A clear attribution to the original project (“Includes code from Caption Studio (https://github.com/rmcc3/caption-studio)”), 
     b) A copy of or link to this License, and
     c) Retention of the copyright notice in all source files where it appears.
   - User-facing products or services must display attribution in a prominent and reasonably visible manner on primary user interfaces (e.g., main UI footer, prominent “About” section reachable within one interaction).

3. Non-Resale / Distribution for a Fee
   - You MAY NOT sell, resell, sublicense for a fee, or otherwise distribute the Software or a Derivative Work as a standalone product or as the primary value of an offering.
   - Determining “primary value”:
     a) If more than 50% of the end-user’s perceived benefit is from the Software, it is considered primary.
     b) Adding trivial features, services, or assets does not shift primary value away from the Software.
   - Sale of installation, configuration, or hosting services is only allowed if bundled with substantial independent value-added services beyond deployment.

4. Derivative Works
   - “Derivative Work” includes modifications, translations, extensions, packaging, containerization, or any work combining the Software with other code or services where the Software remains a core component.
   - Derivative Works are subject to the same Attribution and Non-Resale requirements.

5. No Trademark or Trade Dress Grant
   - No rights are granted to use trade names, trademarks, logos, or distinctive visual styles of the Copyright Owner, except as required for attribution.
   - You may not use similar branding likely to cause confusion, even if trademarks are not directly copied.

6. AI/ML Restrictions
   - The Software and its outputs may not be used to train machine learning models for the purpose of creating substantially similar competing products without a separate commercial license.

7. Third-Party Components
   - You must comply with license terms for all third-party dependencies included in or used with the Software.

8. Compliance, Enforcement, and Termination
   - Any violation of this License automatically terminates your rights under it.
   - Upon termination, you must immediately cease use and distribution and destroy all copies within your control.
   - The Copyright Owner reserves the right to audit use for compliance where legally permissible.

9. Disclaimer of Warranty
   - THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

10. Limitation of Liability
    - IN NO EVENT WILL THE COPYRIGHT OWNER BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR USE THEREOF.

11. Governing Law and Global Applicability
    - This License will be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction of the Copyright Owner.
    - Users outside said jurisdiction agree to the applicability of these terms to the fullest extent allowed by local law.

Definitions
- "You": the licensee.
- "Primary value": as defined in Section 3.
- "Derivative Work": as defined in Section 4.
